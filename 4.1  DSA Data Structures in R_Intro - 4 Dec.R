# Data Structures in R
# Data come in many types and structures which can pose a problem for some...
# ...analysis environments but R handles them with ease.

## VECTOR
# The most common data structure is the one-dimensional vector
# Vector forms the basis of everything in R.
# A vector is collection of elements of same type.
# (ie) A vector cannot be of mixed type.
# R is a Vectorized Language. That means operations are applied to each element of the vector automatically,
# .., without the need to loop through the vector.
# This is a powerful concept and vector plays a crucial and significant role in R.
# Refer the file : "3 All about Vectors in R - 26 Nov" (R File)

## DATA FRAME
# Data Frames(DF) - Most useful features of R & also cited reason for R's ease of use.
# In dataframe, each column is actually a vector, each of which has same length.
# Each column can hold different type of data.
# Also within each column, each element must be of same type, like vectors.

## MATRICES
# A matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions...
#..., arranged in rows and columns.(i.e.) 2-Dimensional Array
# Similar to data.frame(RxC) and also similar to Vector
# Matrix - Element by element operations are possible.
# Refer the file : "4 DSA Data Structures_Matrices - 4 Dec" (R File)

## ARRAYS
# Arrays - An array is essentially a multidimensional vector.
# It must all be of the same type and 
# ...individual elements are accessed using Square Brackets.
# First element is Row(R) Index, Second Element is Column(C) Index and 
# the remaining elements are for Outer Dimensions (OD).
# Refer the file : "4 DSA Data Structures_Arrays - 4 Dec" (R File)

## LIST
# Lists - Stores any number of items of any type.
# List can contain all numerics or characters or...
#...a mix of the two or data.frames or recursively other lists.
# Refer the file : "4 DSA Data Structures_List - 4 Dec" (R File)
